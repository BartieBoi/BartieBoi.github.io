      William Doyle-Madrid, Silly Willy, Wilhelm, or just Will, is an average teenager. He attends school at HSPVA with most of his friends, plays trumpet,
    and loves playing video games with his boys. He has what most would consider a good life- but all that changes. September 6, 2019, a couple hours
    before evening, he visits a friend named Juan to celebrate at his birthday party. The two, joined by several other friends spend the next few hours
    hanging out, playing Smash, and eating dinner. But at 7:57pm, Juan breaks out Jenga- but not any ordinary Jenga- giant home-made Jenga. With
    construction brick sized blocks forming a 4 foot tower, the friends gawked at the intimidating wooden monster. Nevertheless, they procceed with the
    funnest round of Jenga any has ever played. But the fun can't last for too long. As minutes pass the tower grows taller and thinner, the structual
    integrity decreasing by the block. By this point, every person at turn has immeasurably high tension and anxiety, only to let out an exacerbated sigh
    of relief, and that tension to pass to the next person at turn. Anyone could end the game. The question came down to, who would slip up first? Give the
    subject of this article, one can only presume who. Will walked up to the tower, trembling before its majesty. Slowly, he handled his chosen block out, and
    with infinite care, placed it top spot. He removed his hands, his breath still. The tower stood still for a terrifying second, until almost in slow motion
    it collapsed. Will desperately tried to stop it with all his might, but it was to no avail. He was engulfed by the tidalwave of wooden bricks. Every bone being
    exruciatingly crushed, his legs pulverized, his kneecaps rendered no more. His limp body hit the ground, all the while he screams out in pain. His friends equal
    in loudness screaming and laghing at their poor friend's misfortune.

      The image above shows Will enveloped in desparity and pure pain as his game, and kneecaps, are hopelessly lost.
